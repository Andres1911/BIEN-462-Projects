,"JuPt: 2,3,7,8,12,14,15,16,19,26,27,28,29",,,,,,,We train the model using the training set.,,,,,,,,,,
,"GaPt: 3,5,7,8,12,18,19,23,26",,,,,,,We test the model's accuracy on the testing set.,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,We ensure that the model can handle different datasets using the validation set.,,,,,,,,,,
Invalid Age,None,,,,,,,NEVER train the model on the test set or validation set!!!,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Invalid Height,"GaPt: 15,19,21",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"All Ju study data is in cm, not meters. Would need to convert.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,All sets were randomly selected via online RNG tool,,,,,,
Invalid Weight,"GaPt: 04,23",,,,,,,,,,,Total number of samples * set% = number of samples used in set,,,,,,
