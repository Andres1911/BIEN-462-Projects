,,,The X and Y numbers are in an arbitrary coordinate system reflecting,,,,,,,
,,,the relative (arbitrarily scaled) positions of the sensors within each,,,,,,,
,,,"insole. During walking, the sensors inside each insole remain at the",,,,,,,
,,,"same relative position, but the two feet are no longer parallel to",,,,,,,
,,,"each other. Thus, this coordinate system enables a calculation of a",,,,,,,
,,,proxy for the location of the center of pressure (COP) under each,,,,,,,
